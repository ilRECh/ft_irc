        Parameters: [<name> [<o>]]

        The WHO message is used by a client to generate a query which returns
        a list of information which 'matches' the <name> parameter given by
        the client.  In the absence of the <name> parameter, all visible
        (users who aren't invisible (user mode +i) and who don't have a
        common channel with the requesting client) are listed.  The same
        result can be achieved by using a <name> of "0" or any wildcard which

        will end up matching every entry possible.

        The <name> passed to WHO is matched against users' host, server, real
        name and nickname if the channel <name> cannot be found.

        If the "o" parameter is passed only operators are returned according
        to the name mask supplied.

        Numeric Replies:

                   ERR_NOSUCHSERVER
                   RPL_WHOREPLY                    RPL_ENDOFWHO

        Examples:
        
        WHO *.fi                        ; List all users who match against
                                        "*.fi".

        WHO jto* o                      ; List all users with a match against
                                        "jto*" if they are an operator.
