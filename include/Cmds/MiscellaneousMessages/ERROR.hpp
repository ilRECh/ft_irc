        Parameters: <error message>

        The ERROR command is for use by servers when reporting a serious or
        fatal error to its operators.  It may also be sent from one server to
        another but must not be accepted from any normal unknown clients.

        An ERROR message is for use for reporting errors which occur with a
        server-to-server link only.  An ERROR message is sent to the server
        at the other end (which sends it to all of its connected operators)
        and to all operators currently connected.  It is not to be passed
        onto any other servers by a server if it is received from a server.

        When a server sends a received ERROR message to its operators, the
        message should be encapsulated inside a NOTICE message, indicating
        that the client was not responsible for the error.

        Numerics:

        None.

        Examples:

        ERROR :Server *.fi already exists   ; ERROR message to the other server
                                            which caused this error.

        NOTICE WiZ :ERROR from csd.bu.edu -- Server *.fi already exists
                                            ; Same ERROR message as above but sent
                                            to user WiZ on the other server.
