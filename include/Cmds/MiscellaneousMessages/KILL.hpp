        The KILL message is used to cause a client-server connection to be
        closed by the server which has the actual connection.  KILL is used
        by servers when they encounter a duplicate entry in the list of valid
        nicknames and is used to remove both entries.  It is also available
        to operators.

        Clients which have automatic reconnect algorithms effectively make
        this command useless since the disconnection is only brief.  It does
        however break the flow of data and can be used to stop large amounts
        of being abused, any user may elect to receive KILL messages
        generated for others to keep an 'eye' on would be trouble spots.

        In an arena where nicknames are required to be globally unique at all
        times, KILL messages are sent whenever 'duplicates' are detected
        (that is an attempt to register two users with the same nickname) in
        the hope that both of them will disappear and only 1 reappear.

        The comment given must reflect the actual reason for the KILL.  For
        server-generated KILLs it usually is made up of details concerning
        the origins of the two conflicting nicknames.  For users it is left
        up to them to provide an adequate reason to satisfy others who see
        it.  To prevent/discourage fake KILLs from being generated to hide
        the identify of the KILLer, the comment also shows a 'kill-path'
        which is updated by each server it passes through, each prepending
        its name to the path.

        KILL David (csd.bu.edu <- tolsun.oulu.fi)
        ; Nickname collision between csd.bu.edu
        and tolson.oulu.fi


        NOTE:
        It is recommended that only Operators be allowed to kill other users
        with KILL message.  In an ideal world not even operators would need
        to do this and it would be left to servers to deal with.
