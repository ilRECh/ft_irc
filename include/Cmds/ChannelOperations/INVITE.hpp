   Parameters: <nickname> <channel>

   The INVITE message is used to invite users to a channel.  The
   parameter <nickname> is the nickname of the person to be invited to
   the target channel <channel>.  There is no requirement that the
   channel the target user is being invited to must exist or be a valid
   channel.  To invite a user to a channel which is invite only (MODE
   +i), the client sending the invite must be recognised as being a
   channel operator on the given channel.
