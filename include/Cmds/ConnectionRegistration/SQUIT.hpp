   Parameters: <server> <comment>

   The SQUIT message is needed to tell about quitting or dead servers.
   If a server wishes to break the connection to another server it must
   send a SQUIT message to the other server, using the the name of the
   other server as the server parameter, which then closes its
   connection to the quitting server.

   This command is also available operators to help keep a network of
   IRC servers connected in an orderly fashion.  Operators may also
   issue an SQUIT message for a remote server connection.  In this case,
   the SQUIT must be parsed by each server inbetween the operator and
   the remote server, updating the view of the network held by each
   server as explained below.

   The <comment> should be supplied by all operators who execute a SQUIT
   for a remote server (that is not connected to the server they are
   currently on) so that other operators are aware for the reason of
   this action.  The <comment> is also filled in by servers which may
   place an error or similar message here.

   Both of the servers which are on either side of the connection being
   closed are required to to send out a SQUIT message (to all its other
   server connections) for all other servers which are considered to be
   behind that link.

   Similarly, a QUIT message must be sent to the other connected servers
   rest of the network on behalf of all clients behind that link.  In
   addition to this, all channel members of a channel which lost a
   member due to the split must be sent a QUIT message.

   If a server connection is terminated prematurely (e.g. the server  on
   the  other  end  of  the  link  died),  the  server  which  detects
   this disconnection is required to inform the rest of  the  network
   that  the connection  has  closed  and  fill  in  the comment field
   with something appropriate.

   Example:

   SQUIT tolsun.oulu.fi :Bad Link ? ; the server link tolson.oulu.fi has
                                   been terminated because of "Bad Link".

   :Trillian SQUIT cm22.eng.umd.edu :Server out of control
                                    ; message from Trillian to disconnect
                                   "cm22.eng.umd.edu" from the net
                                    because "Server out of control".
